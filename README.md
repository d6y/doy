Why

The Duke of York cinema in Brighton has no feed of what's on. This is a screen-scraping widget to pull the listing into a widget. It turns out the other cinemas in the Picture House chain use the same web site, so the widget also supports those cinemas.
What

This is a widget for Mac OS which fetches the HTML from the cinema web site, pulls out the film information from the page, and shows it in a widget. The widget was created using the default RSS feed example in Dashcode.

It's very very likely to fail as soon as Picture House update their web site. But hopefully they'll add an Atom feed. /me crosses fingers.
Disclaimer

This code has nothing to do with Picture House or the Duke of Yorks.
